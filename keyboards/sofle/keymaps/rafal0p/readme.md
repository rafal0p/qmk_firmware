# Personal keymap for Sofle Keyboard rev1
Features:

- most keys after **double click** + hold send **GUI+key** combination (example - double clicking **A** results in **GUI+A**). It is super useful for macos users
- home row combos with GUI, ALT, CTRL modifiers
- navi layer with:
  - `jkl;` arrows 
  - `h` as backspace and `'` as delete (isn't backspace just a left arrow hungry for letters?)
  - row below `jkl;` with "bigger" version of appropriate action (left arrow - home, down - pg down etc)
- `_` in the same place as space, just on different layer
- encoders with actions done more often than vol up/down:
  - left encoder switching applications or tabs depending on layer
  - right encoder going back'n'forth in history (back/forward) or in _time_ (undo/redo)
- gaming layer without tapdances
- pretty readable `keymap.c`
